# XLS-to-CSV
Tired of converting multiple XLS to CSV? Here's a simple solution.

Add `xlstocsv` to your path and call it like this:

```bash
xlstocsv path/to/file.xls # single file
xlstocsv file1.xls file2.xlsx # multiple files
xlstocsv directory/*.xls # using a glob
xlstocsv directory/**/*.xls # using a recursive glob
```
